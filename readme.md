# YAHTZEE with the magic of JavaScript!

## Summary

Yahtzee is a simple enough dice game and is a great way to exercise skills in vanilla JavaScript. I had to take a breif hiatus from coding, and COVID has brought out my passion for games of all types. Ergo, emulating Yahtzee is an ideal project. Working on this project without the help of something like React or other frameworks after being out of practice for a while is challenging, but really rewarding. 

## Features

The features this project will have upon completion are:

-Ability to play a fully functioning game of Yahtzee, keeping track of score.
-Change dice colors using some event listeners and `<select>` tag manipulation (dice have transparent backgrounds which makes this MUCH easier)
-Predictive score areas: Dice are evaluated and compared to the possible combinations in the scorecard. Ex. If there are three 3's, "9" should appear in the Upper Section's "Count and Add Only 3's" area. 
-Confirmation of new game: In the event a game is already being played and the player attempts to start a new game, a pop-up warning the player that the current game's progress will be lost will come up before continuing. This serves as a quality-of-life aspect.
-Multiplayer?
